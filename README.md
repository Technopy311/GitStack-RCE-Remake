## Why the remake?

I was doing the Wreath network of the platform TryHackMe, 
and in one of the tasks I was challenged to make a little pseudo-shell for the exploit, 
well... 

...I decided to go a little further and then upload the exploit here.

## What's the new stuff?

This Remake does the following:

1. Migrates the exploit from Python2 to Python3.
2. Adds user input.
3. Adds a pseudo shell.
4. Adds better customization.
